# robo_game
a game i am making to practice constructors, aggregation and maybe even enums. also because i never seem to finish a project im going to force myself to start with a CLI game, then go to 2d, then 3d.

The actual gameplay will revolve around acquiring different parts and really getting into the nity gritty of modifying the robot. the mods eventually are going to be the "spice" for encounters, adding different abilities.
